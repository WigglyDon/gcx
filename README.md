# ntx

**Your Nintendo games. Open, play, leave, return.**

ntx continues the same Rust-first public project and repository history formerly
named gcx. It is the Nintendo member of Machine Rhythm's five emulator products.
GameCube works through the maintained direct Dolphin adapter. Nintendo 64 through
Mupen64Plus-Next is the next active implementation, not yet a playable claim.

Active crates/native/JNI/build/branding now use ntx and com.machinerhythm.ntx.
An offline staged migration tool preserves identities, ordinary progress and
legacy recovery scenes; schema 2 separates system/backend routing. The retained
installed GameCube candidate is still the legacy package. A renamed GameCube APK has been built, signed and preserved with its exact
source. The pinned ARM64 N64 core now compiles, with Rust host, graphics/audio,
controls and independent profile/save/scene routing implemented. A combined GameCube/N64 package is also built and privately preserved with its
source. Pixel4 data migration now preserves both original game/profile pairs and exact
ordinary data, with source retained and return verified. Media regrant and
playable N64/save/continuity acceptance remain unfinished. See the
[migration boundary](docs/IDENTITY_MIGRATION.md) and [N64 pin/audit](native/mupen/README.md).
