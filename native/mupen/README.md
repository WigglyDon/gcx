# Pinned N64 integration

Selected core: [Mupen64Plus-Next at 15bada85906593376e8fd697f1b0b3af3a20f512](https://github.com/libretro/mupen64plus-libretro-nx/tree/15bada85906593376e8fd697f1b0b3af3a20f512).
[source-lock.json](source-lock.json) records the root tree, inspected blobs and
optional gitlink. The pin has no .gitmodules; no dependency URL is invented for
its excluded gnulib gitlink. No RetroArch frontend is imported.

The ARM64 GLES3/HLE core compiles and a combined Android package was linked,
signed with the retained identity, checked and privately preserved from source
36e9b732 (APK f946d3c9). Rust owns the libretro adapter, Android EGL/GLES/audio,
N64 controls and independent profile/save/scene routing. Subsequent source edits
need their own bound candidate. No device playable/save/reload/scene or
cross-system acceptance is claimed by these build results.

## Source and reproduction

All 2275 original files were checked against upstream Git blobs. The original
archive's single Windows project CRLF expansion was normalized to the exact Git
blob; source-files.sha256 records that original content. Maintained patches and
patched-files.sha256 separately record checked buffers/results, optional logger
fallback, owned directories, completion-bearing shutdown and coherent state-job
yields. Modified files retain dated change notices and upstream terms.

`cargo xtask mupen-source-check` verifies the complete active graph.
`python3 native/mupen/check_boundary.py` compiles the actual selected header,
state entrypoints and deinit against bounded fixtures, and reproduces both patches
from the retained original archive. It checks ABI layouts, failed results, buffer
admission, completed-job yields, unopened-core shutdown and failed-join retention.
These checks do not execute a console or GPU.

`cargo xtask build-mupen` uses reviewed NDK30, API28, arm64-v8a, GLES3 and one job,
with isolated build/ntx-mupen outputs and 16 KiB ELF alignment. The expanded graph
has [274 compilation inputs](selected-sources.txt), no parallel RSP/RDP, Angrylion
or gnulib, and no M64P_PARALLEL asynchronous save worker. Upstream Android defaults
are overridden explicitly; the selected copy workqueue executes synchronously.
Candidate preservation retains original and complete patched Mupen source,
first-party/Dolphin/dependency bundles, Rust vendor inputs and exact tool/build
bindings. The unsigned source-rebuild route needs no private signer.

## Actual backend boundaries

| Boundary | Implemented ownership and limit |
| --- | --- |
| Media | need_fullpath=false. Scoped cartridge bytes use path=NULL, preventing optional .ndd/.gb/.sav sibling probes. Rust validates bounded z64/v64/n64 magic and fingerprints canonical big-endian bytes without changing GameId or originals. |
| Ordinary storage | RETRO_MEMORY_SAVE_RAM is 296960 bytes: EEPROM2048, four32768-byte Controller Paks, SRAM32768 and FlashRAM131072. Rust owns immutable image generations and an atomic ordinary reference under the profile writer. This is not a universal external native-save converter. |
| Initialization | The core formats saved_memory at load. Rust injects the current image after formatting and before execution; a pending restore reseeds that exact bound generation after cold initialization and validates again. |
| Capture/restore | Selected state includes device protocol and FlashRAM page-buffer/mode/status. Completed jobs yield after clearing the job and before further guest execution. Capture commits ordinary bytes from that boundary before publishing a scene. Restore requires exact core/options/architecture/media/game/profile and actual current ordinary generation; failed mutation is quarantined from publication. |
| Graphics/audio | Android owns a retained EGL3 context, offscreen framebuffer, aspect composition, replacement window surfaces and PCM stereo AudioTrack. The core's threaded renderer is explicitly disabled; callbacks and core calls stay on the native owner thread. Android handles never enter durable game identity. |
| Input | One analog stick, digital C-up/down/left/right, independent digital L/R and Z, D-pad, A/B/Start. Default core mapping is fixed explicitly; pointer capture, quick presses, simultaneous input and cancellation are Rust policy. No GameCube C-stick/analog-shoulder or PS1 mask transplant. |
| Shutdown | An unopened coroutine is never started just to stop it. Native stopped state is acknowledged before library/context release. Failed join/publication retains native memory, host resources and writer ownership; successful teardown keeps the writer through durable session publication. |
| Scheduling | Multiple independent SavedSessions/profiles share one foreground runtime policy. Native globals permit one Mupen instance per process until isolation is qualified; that is a runtime capability, not a one-game identity model. Background pause/silence is the default. |

## Terms and resources

[RESOURCE_AUDIT.md](RESOURCE_AUDIT.md) records selected components and actual
resource provenance. In particular, GLideNHQ xBRZ requires GPLv3; its MAME exception
does not apply to ntx. GPLv3 text, component licenses, source-header notices,
change notices and exact corresponding source accompany the combined candidate.
Original first-party Rust remains MIT and borrowed files retain their terms.
No cartridge, firmware, save, texture pack, copied branding or private device
content is bundled. Public binary/store/legal commitments remain separately gated.
