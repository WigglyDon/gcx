# Product: Nintendo games as durable applications

ntx is the Nintendo member of the five emulator products, sharing PSX's established
game-first experience and architecture. This is continuation of the existing
player, not a restart, sibling merger or shared studio framework.

Choose a local game, play, leave and return to that game's own progress and scene.
One collection spans the supported systems. Execution backends are implementation
choices, not a mandatory core-configuration UI. Keep original sibling branding,
a comfortable layout/editor, system-correct controls and understandable recovery.

## Active delivery

[NTX-5](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5) and
[amendment6505289270](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5#issuecomment-6505289270)
govern. Complete the full ntx identity and safe migration; preserve working direct
Dolphin GameCube support; add N64 now through Mupen64Plus-Next. FN64 may later
replace the N64 adapter without redefining games or ordinary saves. Other Nintendo
systems remain explicit later additions. No all-platform port is being claimed.

Canonical identity: ntx, Android com.machinerhythm.ntx, data root ntx and
machinerhythm-ntx://play/<GameId>. A cosmetic label over permanently active gcx
names is insufficient. Old names remain only in history and isolated migration
compatibility. Package migration must preserve current progress and reacquire
media permission; never silently lose unsaved scenes or uninstall the only source.

## Continuity belongs to each game

Multiple games independently open/resumable on the same and different systems are
the baseline model. One foreground runtime is an initial scheduling policy, not a
permanent singleton. Open, resident-paused, executing, checkpointed/unloaded and
awaiting recovery are different states of the same durable session. Supported
hosts/backends may later provide multiple resident or executing instances.

Ordinary saves record game-committed progress; automatic machine checkpoints
record exact continuation and pause intent. Neither replaces the other. Separate
both from immutable media and layout preferences. Keep errors/incompatible states
recoverable, reject stale generations against newer ordinary progress and offer
explicit cold start. Save identity follows the game, not the backend or host.

## Alpha comfort

Maximize the game picture using actual drawable/aspect; keep controls comfortably
clear and correctly mapped, with simultaneous input, interruption release, editable
profiles and consistent preferred haptics. Pause/Resume/Stop remain reachable.
GameCube has two sticks and distinct analog/click L/R. N64 has one analog stick,
four C buttons and digital shoulders; its persistence is cartridge/Controller Pak,
not a GameCube card. Physical controllers are useful, never a required workaround.

Prioritize real user outcomes over qualification bookkeeping. Reuse earned boot,
ordinary-save, scene-return and timing evidence at its actual build bounds.
Speedrunner/quest-progression automation is retired. Preserve historical defects
without requiring that every unrepeatable report be disproved before product work.
Use short representative changed-behavior checks, protected saves and honest limits.
Optional shortcut limitations do not block the whole alpha.
