# NTX successor handoff

Continue the same project and Git history under
[NTX-5](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5) and binding
[amendment6505289270](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5#issuecomment-6505289270).
Read their latest comments and AGENTS.md. Acknowledge actual checkout, branch,
HEAD, worktrees, dirt and ownership on NTX-5, then implement the next unfinished
slice. This is succession of one worker, not a second concurrent implementation.

## Current successor increment

Sole ownership acknowledged on [NTX-5 comment6507741174](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5#issuecomment-6507741174)
from clean main 3fae28f in this checkout. Active crates/native hooks/JNI/package/
resources/tooling now use ntx. Offline protected schema-1 import and schema-2
system/backend routing are implemented; see [migration](IDENTITY_MIGRATION.md).
The original patch is preserved in native/patches/history. Signer matches its
independent recovery and installed-candidate certificate; original inputs remain.

Pinned N64 source/interfaces and original cartridge/input/save-format policy now
exist; [integration notes](../native/mupen/README.md) record the real restore-result
hazard and remaining work. No libretro execution adapter or playable claim yet.
No phone commands, native heavy build, source-data migration or new linked APK
have been performed. Do not transfer old gameplay acceptance to this increment.
The immediate next step is the linked ntx package and protected device-specific
migration/relink qualification, followed by the pinned N64 execution vertical slice.

## Source and relocation boundary (succession baseline)

Canonical repository: https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx ; stable ID1429193278,
public, branch main. It was renamed IN PLACE from gcx; commits/issues were not
recreated. Pre-succession source is b3a02e570e9f63e94d897c688a2f5f850b054ae6.
The handoff commit(s) at HEAD change current guidance/launch inputs and location
binding only. Resolve their actual SHA with git log; no new app build is implied.
The existing checkout was relocated to an ntx-named directory in the same approved
workspace, preserving root/.git inodes. Preparation commit:
ecb606e07f6aea2e79c0e605bc96078cf9e76c50. The local-only supplement records the
actual location and verified66770real-host entries,8critical file hashes/inodes,
147read-only rebased input pins and26nested Git heads/dirty states. Three empty
sandbox-only mountpoint entries were classified separately; no host files were
missing. The old path is absent, with no alias. The old seed publisher is retired.
Never reconstruct the old directory or leave a compatibility symlink.

Top-level source was clean on entry, with one worktree and no registered top-level
submodules. The ignored Dolphin Git tree has38tracked reviewed modifications and
its selected dependency gitlinks; they are required source, not dirt to reset.
At that outgoing handoff no application/crate/JNI rename or N64 work had started;
current successor source progress is recorded above.
The outgoing worker starts no successor or phone tests and stops at the succession
boundary. Check actual dirt and newer comments before assuming this remains current.

## Working baseline and evidence to keep

Installed legacy GameCube candidate:

- Source f9de0b0bac37f3087802f4d0e8ab7afcf9c1acac; ABI8/stateABI1.
- APK SHA256 b4c921276bb21f5b4392a5f058ad75168203dfdf9099484cb8e3c816f253ff3a.
- Dolphin cf5cb7ef81c3e8e7af5c9d566334219ffda9f68b plus reviewed patch.
- Engine SHA256 d419cc59abbe5fc41c343946d244e17c8d0c041a8a338b2fe8986e6994602e40.
- Resource/patch identities are in docs/state.toml; reproduction in native/README.md.

Current-build Wind Waker ordinary progress acquired Hero's Clothes, saved through
the game, stopped with joined/durable/profile-released acknowledgment and reloaded
from the game menu in a genuinely fresh process with green outfit/23rupees. Earlier
ABI8 checkpoints returned exact unsaved scenes/pause intent and switched WW/TP/WW,
with owner-confirmed sound/input at those original build bounds. Do not transfer
all earlier results automatically to the new package/backend.

[Current acceptance](ACCEPTANCE.md) links exact evidence. Completed boot/native
slice, ordinary-save/reload, earlier scene/library rows and matched stationary
Home timing must not be repeated as fresh tasks. Speedrunner/quest automation is
retired. Original Pixel Pause/reentry and separate Fold process loss/lag remain
open; no guessed cause or clean broad lifecycle pass. Latest probe failed at a
pre-dispatch controller range check, not an observed emulator freeze; same-job
checkpoint/both-profile protection, normal joined Stop and actual return passed.

## Migration obligations still unfinished

The source identity rename and offline protected import are implemented. Finish
linked-package/data migration and its actual qualification. Check the residual
reference ledger, actual source/patch graph and fresh output/tool bindings;
canonical identity is com.machinerhythm.ntx, app-private root ntx and ntx links.
Keep the direct Dolphin adapter; do not convert it to libretro or rewrite its core.
Residual gcx references must be classified as real history/provenance or isolated
legacy readers/fixtures. This is not a blanket replacement inside vendor code,
old hashes, binary payloads or private evidence.

Preserve the existing signer/certificate, GameIds, SaveProfileIds, current cards,
console data, preferences/layouts and complete generations. A changed Android
package does not inherit old private files or document grants. Implement protected,
staged/validated, atomic and idempotent migration with newer-target refusal;
reacquire/relink media access without redefining the game. No removal/clear of the
only source installation or silent unsaved-scene discard. Never change a snapshot
fingerprint merely to load it. Retain incompatible checkpoints and legacy recovery
candidate, with explicit cold-start/current-save choice. Pixel and Fold migration
must be qualified independently under their actual authority.

Relocation invalidates absolute paths in cached executables/CMake and old pinned
recipes. The private supplement identifies them. Retain historical records; derive
new active build inputs at their current locations, reconfigure project-owned
outputs when needed, and never revive retired storage/old-path aliases. No heavy
build reservation follows from a small local-storage qualification.

## N64 is active, with one collection and separate axes

Pin Mupen64Plus-Next source/resources/dependencies and inspect the actual selected
save/state/input/render/audio interfaces. Integrate its Android ARM64 GLES3/
GLideN64 route through a small Rust libretro host; package the core, not RetroArch.
No new donor tour. Keep it beside the working direct Dolphin GameCube adapter.

Host platform/device, emulated system and execution backend are separate. Portable
Rust owns collection/game/session/save/resume/input policy and scheduling. Host
adapters own ephemeral surfaces/audio/platform access. Backends own execution and
system-specific persistence. Add explicit system/backend/versioned capabilities;
legacy schema-1 entries migrate to GameCube with IDs/progress intact. N64 media
validation uses cartridge bytes, not suffix alone; use the owner's existing local
cartridges through scoped import, never a broad disk crawl or game download.

GameId, SaveProfile, SavedSession and LiveRuntime remain distinct. Many independent
open/resumable games on the same or different systems are the model. One foreground
execution slot initially is policy, not a permanent singleton architecture.
Represent execution/resident-paused/checkpointed/recovery states without new IDs;
future placement/isolation must not rewrite saves. A process pool does not gate
the first N64 slice. Ordinary saves and exact machine resume are separate; audit
cached save bytes/pending writes in capture/restore and prevent stale/partial
state cleanup from corrupting newer ordinary progress. Cross-backend/architecture
machine snapshots are not promised.

N64 needs its own stick, four C buttons, digital shoulders, cartridge saves and
Controller Pak formats; do not reuse GameCube analog triggers/C Stick/card sizes.
FN64 can later replace an N64 execution adapter without redefining game/progress;
ordinary conversion is validated separately from Mupen-state compatibility. PSX is
the established architectural reference; inspect selected public source/licenses
as needed, without modifying PSX, FN64 or the other siblings.

## Ownership, blockers and private recovery

The fresh successor becomes the sole implementation owner after outgoing handback.
NTX-5 owns execution order: full identity/migration, first playable N64, then
backend-supported continuity/cross-system switching and comfortable alpha checks.
No new Master ceremony is required after each authorized successful slice.
Historical incidents remain disclosed, not prerequisites for disproving every old
report. No active phone request/return obligation existed at reconciliation.

Real unfinished work: new Android package/data migration, complete source rename,
Mupen integration and license/resource audit, supported save/state semantics and
representative affected-boundary qualification. No ntx APK or playable N64 result
exists yet. Device access/capacity/tools require fresh actual admission/readiness;
Fold is personal and needs a fresh window. No new hardware grant is implied.

Local-only supplement: .local/succession-20261029/NTX_PRIVATE_HANDOFF.md under this
checkout (ignored, never publish). It locates signer/recovery candidates, current
card/checkpoint archives, donor/tool inputs, private incident evidence, prior
recipes and path/inode/hash verification. Do not print keys, device identities,
raw captures/logs or game/save content. Some archive versions/storage were explicitly
retired; old receipts do not make them available. Preserve the retained set.
