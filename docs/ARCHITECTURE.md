# ntx architecture contracts

Binding authority: [NTX-5](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5) and
[amendment6505289270](https://github.com/WigglyDon/ntx/issues/5#issuecomment-6505289270).
These are required current contracts. Active identity, schema-2 routing and
offline staged import are implemented. A renamed GameCube package is built and
preserved; device migration remains unqualified. The pinned N64 core compiles
and the Rust execution/Android resource/save/scene implementation is in source;
A combined package is linked/audited; device acceptance remains unfinished. The preserved GameCube baseline is documented in
[historical architecture](history/GCX_ARCHITECTURE.md) and native/README.md.

## Three independent axes

| Axis | Owner and examples |
| --- | --- |
| Host platform/device | Window/surface, audio delivery, scoped media access, lifecycle, launch integration; Android now, other host adapters later |
| Emulated system | Media/controller/save semantics: GameCube and Nintendo64 |
| Execution backend | Console execution and machine format: direct Dolphin and Mupen64Plus-Next; possible FN64 N64 adapter later |

Portable Rust owns collection, durable identities, ordinary-save policy, resume
intent, input semantics and scheduling. Host and backend adapters provide explicit
capabilities. Keep Android content grants, PIDs, native instances, GPU/JIT resources
and process slots out of portable identity. Reacquire host media access without
creating a different game. Do not bind the universal model to Android or one GPU
API; platform agnosticism does not claim that all ports already work.

The portable collection validates opaque media locators without requiring an
Android URI scheme. A verified relocation can replace a host binding while
retaining IDs, profiles and scene references. Android's adapter accepts only its
scoped content documents and requires its own grant; accepting a locator in the
model supplies no access capability or implemented desktop/other-host port.

## Independent per-game continuity

- GameId: durable game/media identity, independent of host and backend.
- SaveProfile: explicitly owned ordinary progress; exactly one writer through
  native teardown and durable metadata publication.
- SavedSession: that game's continuation, pause intent, selected media and
  checkpoint compatibility; outlives its runtime.
- LiveRuntime: temporary execution/resources assigned to a session.

Many independent games can be open on the same or different systems. Executing,
resident-paused, checkpointed/unloaded and recovery-pending are session states or
placements. One foreground slot is the first scheduling policy, not a permanent
singleton architecture or one session per console. Later bounded slots/process
isolation must not redefine IDs or place progress in console-global writable
storage. Native globals may require process isolation; no unqualified double
instantiation. Background pause/silence is the default, with no fake keepalive.

## Ordinary progress and machine state

Keep immutable media, ordinary game-owned saves, machine checkpoints/consistency
metadata and host preferences separate. A layout edit must not change save identity.
N64 cartridge/Controller Pak storage and GameCube card/GCI persistence use their
actual formats and backend owners, not a universal raw-card assumption.

Inspect each selected core's capture/restore boundaries: persistent bytes, caches,
device protocol state and pending writes. Capture/publish a coherent generation.
Before restore validate its relationship to actual current ordinary files. A stale
or partial restore must not flush invalid bytes over newer progress during cleanup.
Do not blindly attach newer saves to an older machine or rewrite fingerprints to
force a load. Retain incompatible checkpoints/errors and offer explicit recovery
or cold start from current saves. Ordinary conversion and exact machine-state
compatibility are separate; neither cross-backend nor cross-architecture state
compatibility is promised.

## Two real adapters

Retain the inspected direct Dolphin GameCube native adapter and its patched source,
resources, threads, render/audio/input/card/state boundaries and provenance. New
first-party ownership stays Rust; useful C/C++ remains. Use existing emulated boot
and DSP-HLE. No BIOS campaign, Dolphin-to-libretro conversion or whole-core rewrite.

For N64 pin/review Mupen64Plus-Next and dependencies, starting with its Android
ARM64 GLES3/GLideN64 route behind a small Rust libretro host. Use core/API, not
RetroArch UI. Own the hardware context lifecycle, core options/environment,
scoped content, audio, N64 input and save publication at actual boundaries. Do not
force it into Dolphin Vulkan or run emulation on the UI thread. Pause/quiesce,
flush, capture/restore and stop/join acknowledge actual completion or failure.

Collection::decode explicitly upgrades schema-1 entries to GameCube/Dolphin in
schema 2 while retaining IDs and progress. The unsafe direct adapter declarations
now live under backend::dolphin; N64 cartridge/input/save-format policy lives in
n64. The small backend::mupen adapter uses a qualified process slot, callback ABI
and instance-owned backend directories. Android supplies EGL3/offscreen drawing,
surface replacement, AudioTrack delivery and measured system-correct touch input.
N64 ordinary generations and checkpoints have their own Rust owners and do not
reuse Dolphin cards or machine containers. Exact native/options/architecture/
media/profile/ordinary bindings are checked; failed restores cannot publish native
ordinary memory. State jobs yield at completion before further guest execution.
A failed native join retains code/context/host and profile writer ownership.
Linked/device results remain separately required. A future
FN64 adapter can use the same N64 entries with validated ordinary-save conversion;
it does not inherit Mupen checkpoint compatibility. Do not alter FN64 itself.

## Rename and Android migration

Canonical package/JNI is com.machinerhythm.ntx, root ntx and link scheme
machinerhythm-ntx. Rename active crates, modules, exports, native libraries, build
inputs/artifacts, labels and current docs comprehensively. Isolate legacy readers
and fixtures; preserve vendor names, authorship, historical hashes and records.

New Android package identity does not inherit old app-private files or URI grants,
even with the same signer. Preserve the current source independently, stage/validate
imports, publish atomically, make retries idempotent and reject overwriting newer
target progress. Preserve GameIds/SaveProfileIds, preferences, ordinary files and
complete generations. Relink media without ROM duplication or new IDs. Old links
can parse compatibly; package-targeted pinned icons may require re-pinning. Retire
legacy installations only after verified migration/rollback under actual custody.

## Verification scope

Use affected-boundary fixtures and a few representative journeys: two same-system
games remain independent; cross-system switching restores the correct session;
process loss preserves durable continuation; stale/failed restore cannot damage
newer ordinary saves. Qualify supported residency separately from checkpoint
fallback. Do not block the N64 vertical slice on a process pool, all-platform
campaign or quest automation. The current owner assignment and handoff order
identity/migration, first playable N64, then supported continuity/alpha comfort.
